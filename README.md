**Welcome to Lindy's Portfolio! Here, you'll find a summary of the projects I've done so far.**

I'm a recent graduate in Information Systems with a strong interest in data analytics, visualization, and user-centered design. I enjoy turning complex data into clear, actionable insights through interactive dashboards and thoughtful storytelling. With hands-on experience using tools like D3.js, Python, SQL, and Power BI, I focus on making data approachable and useful for decision-makers. I'm currently seeking opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven projects and grow as a data analyst or business intelligence professional.
